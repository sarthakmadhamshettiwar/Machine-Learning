# Machine-Learning

I have tried to implement Linear regression (univariate) from scratch (only used numpy and pandas).
This is sample project in which I have used datad.txt file for training the neural network. One can open this .ipynb file on google colab or on any other platform, can upload his/her own data and make some changes in the code (like changing name of the input file), and can run this file.

I have implemented Gradient Descent for optimizing the cost of Regression.

I have also printed all the individual losses of each iteration, to verify that loss is decreasing and hence our Gradient descent is performing properly.
