# Machine-Learning
Some standard Machine Learning algorithms.


This repo contains some standard Machine Learning Algorithms (currently only one) which are implemented from scratch only by using numpy and pandas.
Currently it has Jupyter Notebook containing code of Univariate Linear Regression (Cost function, Gradient Descent).
